In this mino-project, it involves the analysis of real data. The analysis methods include principal component analysis (PCA), analysis of matches (AFC), multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), FDA. The analysis is under the SPAD environment.  

We exploit the census dataset from Los Angeles – Long Beach area (U.S.) by the following questions:

- Question 1: How can we summarize all the numerical variables in the dataset?  What are the links between them?
- Question 2: Is there any link between the race of the persons and the type of the school where he was enrolled?
- Question 3: Considering almost the well given information, can we cluster the persons according to them (Education, marital status, occupation information)?
- Question 4: How can we predict that a person has already moved from his former household?
